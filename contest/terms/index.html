<p>The company METEO-PARAPENTE SAS with a share capital of 1000 euros, hereinafter referred to as the "organizing company," whose registered office is located at 110 impasse de Pre Baron 73110 La Chapelle Blanche, France, registered under the number RCS Chambéry 848 908 646, is organizing a contest with a purchase obligation, hereinafter referred to as the "contest."</p>
<p>This contest is organized in partnership with the publishing companies of the websites gleitschirm-shop.ch and soaringshop.fr. It is specified that only the company METEO-PARAPENTE bears the responsibility for this contest.</p>
<h2 id="article-2-duration-of-the-operation">Article 2: Duration of the Operation</h2>
<p>This contest will start on July 22, 2023, at 00:00 and will end on September 23, 2023, at 23:59 (UTC time).</p>
<h2 id="article-3-participation-modalities">Article 3: Participation Modalities</h2>
<p>This contest is exclusively open to adults on the start date of the contest, regardless of their country of residence.</p>
<p>The following are excluded from the contest:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Persons who do not meet the above conditions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employees of the organizing company, its officers, and anyone who directly or indirectly participated in the design, realization, or management of the contest, as well as their spouse and family members (direct or other relatives living or not under the same roof).</p>

<p>Persons belonging to one of the professional categories concerned by the anti-gift provision of the Law for the Future of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry No. 2014-1170 of October 13, 2014.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Proven attempted fraud or cheating by a participant may result in a permanent ban from participating in the present contest.</p>
<p>The organizing company reserves the right to ask any participant to provide justification for the above-mentioned conditions. Any person who does not meet these conditions or refuses to provide justification will be excluded from the contest and, in case of winning, will not be able to benefit from the prize. Only one participation per Meteo-Parapente user (same email address) is allowed. Participation in the contest implies full acceptance of these rules in their entirety, as well as the laws and regulations in force in France.</p>
<h2 id="article-4-conditions-of-participation">Article 4: Conditions of Participation</h2>
<p>To validate participation in the contest, the participant must have subscribed or renewed a subscription or membership on the Meteo-Parapente website between January 1, 2023, 00:00, and September 23, 2023, 23:59 (UTC time), and must not have exercised or be exercising their right of withdrawal within 15 days.</p>
<p>No other action is required.</p>
<h2 id="article-5-prize">Article 5: Prize</h2>
<p>The unique prize is, at the choice of the winner:</p>
<h3 id="prize-1-a-paragliding-wing">Prize 1: A paragliding wing</h3>
<p>Brand, model, and size at the winner's choice, among the models available in the catalogs of the online stores gleitschirm-shop.ch and soaringshop.fr.</p>
<p>This is the wing alone, and not a complete equipment.</p>
<p>For safety reasons, the winner must justify the adequacy of the chosen wing with respect to their level of practice, through any means they deem relevant (qualification, sports record, instructor's certificate, etc.). In the absence of being able to justify their level of practice, the winner will be limited to choosing a wing of category EN-A.</p>
<p>In case of unavailability of the chosen model for reasons beyond Météo-Parapente's control (out of stock, model discontinued by the manufacturer, long delays), the winner will be invited to choose another model from the same catalogs.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-prize-1-a-one-week-paragliding-initiation-course">Alternative Prize 1: A one-week paragliding initiation course,</h3>
<p>excluding transport and accommodation, for two persons, at a school of the organizer's choice, in consultation with the winner.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
All expenses incurred after the contest, especially for the use of these prizes, are entirely the responsibility of the winner.</p>
<h2 id="article-6-selection-of-winners">Article 6: Selection of Winners</h2>
<p>At the end of the contest, there will be a draw of the winner (1 person) who has complied with the provisions of Article 4 herein.

<h2 id="article-7-announcement-of-winners">Article 7: Announcement of Winners</h2>
<p>The name of the winner will be displayed on the Meteo-Parapente website.</p>
<p>The winner will be contacted by email, at the address provided during their subscription.</p>
<h2 id="article-8-prize-delivery">Article 8: Prize Delivery</h2>
<p>The prizes will be shipped to the postal address or to a nearby pickup point via a carrier. In the case of delivery outside France, any customs and importation fees and taxes will be borne by Meteo-Parapente. The winners undertake to accept the prizes as proposed, without the possibility of exchange, especially for cash, other goods, or services of any nature, nor transferring the benefit to a third party. Similarly, these prizes cannot be subject to compensation requests. The organizing company reserves the right, in case of events beyond its control, especially related to its suppliers or unforeseeable circumstances, to replace the announced prizes with prizes of equivalent value. The winner will be informed of any changes. The prizes will be sent as soon as possible, subject to supplier availability.</p>
<h2 id="article-9-data-processing">Article 9: Data Processing</h2>
<p>The participants' information is recorded and used by the organizing company to keep track of their participation in the contest and allow the awarding of prizes. Participants may, for legitimate reasons, object to the processing of their personal data communicated in the context of this contest. They also have the right to object to their use for commercial prospecting purposes, other than participating in this contest, which they can assert from the registration of their participation by sending a request by mail to the organizing company, whose address is mentioned in Article 1.</p>
<p>The winner(s) authorize the organizing company to use their contact information (name, first name) for advertising or public relations purposes on any medium, without conferring any remuneration, right, or advantage, other than the awarding of their prize. In accordance with the French Data Protection Act of January 6, 1978, each participant has the right to request the rectification, completion, clarification, updating, or erasure of information concerning them that is inaccurate, incomplete, ambiguous, or outdated, by sending a request by mail to the organizing company, whose address is mentioned in Article 1.</p>
<h2 id="article-10-refund-conditions">Article 10: Refund Conditions</h2>
<p>Internet connection expenses incurred by the participant will be reimbursed according to the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only one refund per month per household (same name, same postal address)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximum connection duration allowing a contribution of 5 minutes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Current Internet service providers currently offer free or flat-rate connections to Internet users. It is expressly agreed that any access to the site made on a free or flat-rate basis will not entitle the participant to any refund, as the subscription to the access services of the Internet service provider is contracted by the user for general Internet use, and the fact that the participant connects to the site and participates in the game does not incur any</p>
<p>additional costs. Connection expenses will be reimbursed in case of paid connection billed pro rata of the communication duration. In the event of a connection subject to a flat-rate payment for a specified duration and, beyond this duration, billed pro rata of the communication duration, connection expenses to the site will be reimbursed to the participant as soon as it is established that the participant has exceeded the available flat rate and that this flat rate has been exceeded due to the connection to the site. To obtain the reimbursement of their connection expenses, as well as the postage expenses for their refund request, the participant must send a written request on plain paper, with the postmark as proof, to the organizing company within one month of incurring these expenses. The request must contain the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Indication of their names, first names, and personal postal address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indication of the dates, times, and durations of their connections to the site</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A copy of the detailed invoice from the telephone operator and/or the Internet service provider to which they are subscribed, showing the dates and times of their connections to the site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The postage expenses necessary for requesting reimbursement of connection expenses will be reimbursed upon request, based on the current slow postal rate. Connection expenses on the site for participation in the game will be reimbursed by check within two months of receiving the participant's request.</p>
<h2 id="article-11-contest-rules">Article 11: Contest Rules</h2>
<p>The rules can be sent free of charge to anyone who requests them from the organizing company.</p>
<h2 id="article-12-industrial-and-intellectual-property">Article 12: Industrial and Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>Reproduction, representation, or exploitation of all or part of the elements composing the contest, including these rules, are strictly prohibited. All trademarks, logos, texts, images, videos, and other distinctive signs reproduced on the site, as well as on the sites to which it allows access via hypertext links, are the exclusive property of their respective owners and are protected as such by the provisions of the French Intellectual Property Code and applicable laws worldwide. Unauthorized reproduction, in whole or in part, of these trademarks, logos, and signs constitutes counterfeiting, punishable by criminal sanctions. Participation in this contest implies the full and unconditional acceptance of these rules by the participants.</p>
<h2 id="article-13-non-responsibility-force-majeure">Article 13: Non-Responsibility -- Force Majeure</h2>
<p>The organizing company reserves the right to extend, shorten, modify, or cancel the contest at any time, particularly in case of force majeure, without any compensation being claimed by the participants. The responsibility of the organizing company cannot be engaged in case of force majeure or events beyond its control. The organizing company cannot be held responsible for delays, losses, thefts, damages to mail, or the legibility of postmarks due to postal services. It also cannot be held responsible, and no recourse can be made against it, in case of the occurrence of events that have the characteristics of force majeure (strikes, bad weather, pandemics, economic sanctions, world war, nuclear apocalypse, and any other completely improbable events...) that partially or totally prevent participants from participating in the contest and/or winners from enjoying their winnings. The organizing company, as well as its providers and partners, cannot be held responsible for any incidents that may occur in the use of the prizes by the beneficiaries or their guests. It is hereby reminded that paragliding is an activity with multiple risks, requiring appropriate training, physical and meteorological conditions, and equipment. Similarly, the organizing company, as well as its providers and partners, cannot be held responsible for the loss or theft of the prizes by the beneficiaries once the winners have taken possession of them. Any additional costs necessary for taking possession of the prizes are entirely borne by the winners, and they cannot request any compensation from the organizing company or the supplier or partner companies.</p>
<h2 id="article-14-disputes-claims">Article 14: Disputes &amp; Claims</h2>
<p>These rules are governed by French law. The organizing company reserves the right to settle without appeal any difficulty that may arise regarding the interpretation or application of these rules, it being understood that no dispute will be accepted, particularly on the terms of the contest, the results, the prizes, or their receipt, one month after the end of the contest. Except in cases of manifest errors, it is agreed that the information resulting from the organizing company's gaming systems shall be conclusive in any dispute concerning connection elements and the computerized processing of said information relating to the contest. Any claim must be addressed to the organizing company within one month following the end date of the contest. After this date, no claims will be accepted. Participation in the contest implies full acceptance of these rules.</p>
<h2 id="article-15-convention-of-proof">Article 15: Convention of Proof</h2>
<p>By express agreement between the participant and the organizing company, the computer systems and files of the organizing company will be the only evidence. The computerized records kept in the computer systems of the organizing company under reasonable security and reliability conditions are considered as evidence of the relationships and communications between the organizing company and the participant. It is therefore agreed that, except for manifest errors, the organizing company may rely, in particular for the purposes of proof of any act, fact, or omission, on the programs, data, files, records, operations, and other elements (such as monitoring reports or other states) of a computerized or electronic nature or format, established, received, or retained directly or indirectly by the organizing company, particularly in its computer systems. The elements considered are thus evidence and, if they are produced as evidence by the organizing company in any contentious or other procedure, they will be admissible, valid, and opposable between the parties in the same way, under the same conditions, and with the same probative force as any document established, received, or retained in writing. Operations of any nature carried out using the identifier and code assigned to a participant, following registration, are presumed incontrovertibly to have been carried out under the participant's responsibility.</p>
