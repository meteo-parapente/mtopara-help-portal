### 1. Scope and opposability of the General Conditions of Use

The purpose of these General Conditions (hereinafter the "GTU") is to define the services offered on the Site and their conditions of use for all users (hereinafter individually the "User" or collectively the " Users".

Meteo-Parapente is a service offering weather forecasts for outdoor activities (hereinafter individually the "Service" and collectively the "Services").

The User can access the Site free of charge. However, in order to be able to use the Services in their entirety, he must subscribe to a Subscription.

The purpose of these T&Cs is to define the rights and obligations of any User in the context of their access to and use of the Site, and in particular in the context of the provision of the Services.

It is specified that in the case of Users who have subscribed to a Subscription, their relationship with the Publisher will be governed by these T&Cs, which will be supplemented by the Specific Subscription Conditions.

### 2. Description of Services

The Services offered on the Site are as follows:

-   The provision of weather forecasts based on digital models designed by the Publisher or its partners.

-   On an experimental basis, other Services may be offered. These may be Services relating to other territories or other functionalities. If so, this will be indicated. The Publisher does not undertake to maintain them.

It is specified that within the framework of the Services freely provided by the Publisher (hereinafter the "Free Services"), the User's access to the forecasts is restricted. Thus, the User of Free Services will not necessarily be able to access all of the forecasts on the Site.

The Publisher reminds that it sets at its sole discretion the days during which the Services are freely accessible. As such, the time(s) of the week during which access to forecasts on the Site is restricted may be modified from one week to another, without justification of any sort of the Editor.

*For example, the Publisher may decide to restrict access to forecasts for Free Users on Tuesday one week, then restrict access to forecasts on Thursday and Saturday the following week.*

This description of the Free Services is neither exhaustive nor definitive. The Publisher reserves the right to modify the terms of implementation of the Services or to add new functionalities, and in particular with the aim of improving the quality of the Services offered.

### 3. Acceptance of the General Conditions of Use

The User acknowledges having read these T&Cs prior to any access to and/or any use of the Site.

Consequently, continuing to browse the Site implies unreserved acceptance of the T&Cs.

To this end, information is presented to Users during the first visit, in order to obtain their consent.

Refusal of these T&Cs entails a ban on accessing the Site and using the Services it offers.

### 4. Modification of the T&Cs

The Publisher reserves the right to modify these T&Cs at any time, such modifications taking effect as soon as they are put online.

The User is informed of these modifications by all appropriate means.

In order to be able to continue to access and use the Site after the updated T&Cs have been put online, the User will be invited, on their next connection to the Platform, to read the new version of the T&Cs, and to accept them without reservation.

### 5. Conditions of access to the Platform

Viewing the Site (subject to the provisions of Article 3) does not require any registration or creation of an account or profile by the User beforehand.

Provided that the User has the material and technical means allowing him to access the Site (equipment, connections), the Platform is therefore open to any User with an Internet connection, subject to compliance with these T&Cs.

### 6. Availability and operation

The User acknowledges that the characteristics and constraints of the Internet do not guarantee the security, availability and integrity of data transmissions on the Internet.

The Publisher implements its best efforts so that the Services are available at all times, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, without interruption or error.

However, the User accepts that the Services may be temporarily interrupted in the event of a breakdown or to allow maintenance, updating and improvement of the Site.

The Services may also be suspended in the event of the unavailability of meteorological data providers (and in particular Météo-France). Meteo-Parapente uses many sources of data that it does not control and which can, in the event of alteration of this data, modify the functioning of the Site.

The User acknowledges that the Publisher, like any other worker, has the right to take vacation. The Publisher will take precautions to avoid any cuts during his absence. However, if, despite these precautions, a breakdown or disruption should occur, it is possible that the Services will remain disrupted or unavailable until his return. This is particularly valid in the case where the publisher does not have stable access to the Internet during his vacation (eg: offshore navigation or hiking in an isolated environment). In the event of such a disturbance, article 11 of the Specific Subscription Conditions is applicable to Subscribers.

To access the Site, you must use a browser with a version less than three years old.

The responsibility of the Publisher cannot be sought in the event that the conditions of access to the Site cannot be satisfied. The Publisher will nevertheless take all necessary measures, as soon as it becomes aware of the occurrence of the incident, to remedy as quickly as possible any failure that may be attributable to it, as well as to reasonably prevent the occurrence of such malfunctions.

Similarly, the Publisher cannot be held responsible for non-functioning, impossibility of access or poor conditions of use of the Site for reasons external to the Publisher such as network congestion, unsuitability of your equipment or failure of your access provider.

### 7. Responsibilities

The forecasts available on Meteo-Parapente are made using data from a large number of weather operators and calculations made by the Publisher and its partners.

These are forecasts resulting from an automated process, not appraised, carried out without control, intervention, or human analysis a posteriori.

The Publisher does not offer a meteorological service and has no particular qualification in meteorology.

The User therefore acknowledges that the information made available to him on the Site may be incomplete and non-exhaustive.

The User acknowledges that the information available on the Site and the Services offered are the result of automatic data processing, the reliability of which the Publisher and its partners cannot guarantee.

In addition, the Publisher reminds the User, who accepts it, that it makes every effort to provide the Services, but that it necessarily remains dependent on the various meteorological data operators.

The Publisher therefore does not guarantee the availability of forecasts at all times, regardless of access to the Platform, and its liability can never be engaged in the event of unavailability of the Services due to lack of meteorological data operators. .

The User accepts that the use of the information and Services is carried out under his sole and entire responsibility, direction and under his sole control.

The information available on the Site and the Services offered must be used in addition to other information.

The decision to fly, or to carry out an outdoor activity must in no case be taken solely on the basis of the information available on the Site and the Services offered.

The information available on the Site must be supplemented by real-time observation of weather conditions at the departure site or any other available information relating to flight conditions or the practice of any other outdoor activity.

The User acknowledges that he is aware of the safety rules concerning the practice of paragliding or the outdoor activity he practices. In particular, the User acknowledges having sufficient knowledge of meteorology and aerology to practice paragliding or any other outdoor activity. The User acknowledges that he should only fly or practice an outdoor activity under conditions adapted to this activity and his level.

The User acknowledges that the decision to fly or the decision to practice any other outdoor activity is taken at his own risk.

The Publisher is bound by an obligation of means, and its liability can only be engaged on proven fault on its part. This obligation of means only concerns the fact of providing the forecasts, without however guaranteeing their reliability, precision or veracity.

When the User uses the Site and the Services in the context of his professional activity, he acknowledges that the responsibility of the Publisher cannot, in any way whatsoever, be engaged in the event of direct or indirect damage which would be caused to him. due to the use of the information and Services offered by the Site or the impossibility of accessing the information and Services offered by the Site. In particular, the loss of turnover, commercial damage, loss of order, any commercial problems, damage to brand image and any action taken by third parties are considered to be indirect damages.

Consequently, the User declares and recognizes the limits that any reasonable person attaches to the weather forecasts, and consequently to those provided within the framework of the Services. As such, the User declares:

-   Be solely responsible for the use he makes of the forecasts obtained within the framework of the Services,

-   In no case or in any situation can the Publisher be held liable for compensation for any direct or indirect damage resulting from the use of the forecasts provided,

-   To be fully aware of the uncertainties necessarily linked to the Services, in particular in view of the provisions of this article.

The Publisher may decide to withdraw the Applications from the portals on which they are made available, at its discretion and without any obligation to replace them with any other technical solution.

The User acknowledges that each Application is an accessory technical solution to the Services offered on the Platform. As such, the User has no right to have the Applications kept available by the Publisher, nor any right to reimbursement or compensation in the event of non-maintenance.

Access to the Applications and their use are subject to these T&Cs, under conditions strictly identical to those governing access to and use of the Site.
